# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

# Create IAM Users
1. By default when we create an AWS account, we get a root user.
2. Using root account, we can create and provide access to many users using IAM (Identity Access Management)
3. When create IAM users, we add them to a group (Group has list of permissible services which those users can have access to)
    i. For eg. In a project, you want only certain set of users who can have access to DynamoDB, whereas others can have access to Amplify
4. We can set up an alias for our AWS account (web address)
5. Set up MFA.
